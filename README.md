1. Open the browser
2. Navigate to YouTube
3. Search for video
4. Play video

Four steps to play a video? That's a bit too much for lazy people. Why not bring it down to two steps or even one? Use Youtube Viewer module for Project Butler to do that. 

## Commands

- ``yplay {id}`` - Directly play videos if you know their IDs.
- ``ysearch {name}`` - Search for videos and choose one from the results to play.
- ``yforce {name}`` - Play the first video that pops up in the search results.

## Installation
Just unzip the zip file in the releases section of this repository to the Modules folder of Project Butler. All dependancies included.
